Use the solution to your weekend homework (or use our solution). Add a controller and views to render a list of all the films in an unordered list.

User Needs
"As a cinema goer I want to visit localhost:4567/films and see a list of films"

Create a controller.rb
Create a views directory
Create a new file called index.erb inside the directory
In the controller.rb, use the Film.all() method to get all the film objects and pass them to the view.
##Helpful Hints

Remember to check the database name, you may need to create/recreate it, run the sql file to make the tables and run the console.rb to add some sample data.
Remember the difference between <% %> and <%= %>
You may need to use a for loop in the view file to display all the films...
